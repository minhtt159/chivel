# Chapter 1: HostOS & Hardening

## HostOS

All nodes are running Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS. I was trying to use netboot.xyz but it didn't work, so I had to install it manually.

You can use Rasberry Pi Imager to flash the USB/SSD to Ubuntu; or use any other tools.

## Hardening

After installing Ubuntu, update/upgrade everthing (even bootloader) and set **static IP** for all nodes.

I would like to harden a little bit more, so TBD
